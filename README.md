# BIRD BEBOP

## Welcome to Manhattan, 1943! Meet Dizzy, a pigeon with an affinity for jazz (like most in New York at the time) with dreams of planting trees around his deteriorating, post-Industrial Revolution urban jungle landscape. 

## Dizzy must fly through obstacles to collect plants to get to his final destination, where he can plant the greenery he has collected! Help Dizzy along his journey using our custom game controller created with Arduino Nano, a potentiometer that lets you move left and right, and a push down button that lets you jump. 

## Created across Unity, Arduino IDE, and Python, Bird Bebop is a game for all bird-lovers, platform game enthusiasts, environmentally conscious citizens, and of course, listeners of jazz! 

## Together, letâ€™s help Dizzy plant!
